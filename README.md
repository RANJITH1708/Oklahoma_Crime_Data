# Oklahoma Crime Data Analysis Project Report

## Introduction

The Oklahoma Crime Data Analysis Project investigates crime trends across Oklahoma cities from 2014 to 2023. The project integrates crime statistics, geographic coordinates, and labor data to standardize inconsistent datasets, establish a robust MySQL database, impute missing values, and derive actionable insights through correlation analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive visualizations in Power BI. The tools utilized include VBA, Python, SQL, and Power BI, enabling comprehensive data cleaning, organization, analysis, and presentation.

## Data Collection and Preparation

### Data Sources

The crime data was sourced from the FBI Crime Data Explorer, specifically the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) Tables, which provide incident-based crime data for Oklahoma. The dataset was initially downloaded as a PDF from [https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#) and subsequently converted into Excel format for processing.

### Initial Data Cleaning

Upon conversion to Excel, the dataset exhibited several issues:

- **Merged Columns**: The Excel sheet contained merged columns, which were manually corrected to ensure proper data structure.

### Challenges

Further examination revealed inconsistencies across the annual datasets (2014â€“2023):

- **Missing Columns**:
  - `animal_cruelty`, `identity_theft`, and `hacking_computer_invasion` were absent in 2014 and 2015.
  - `sex_offenses_non_forcible` was missing in 2018, 2019, and from 2020 to 2023.
- **Renamed Columns**:
  - In 2023, the `fondling` offense was renamed to `criminal_sexual_contact`. To maintain consistency across years, it was reverted to `fondling`, despite slight definitional differences: `fondling` refers to intentional, non-consensual touching of intimate areas for sexual gratification, often categorized as a forcible sex offense, whereas `criminal_sexual_contact` is a broader legal term that may include `fondling` but also other forms of non-consensual sexual touching without penetration.

### Standardization Process

To address these discrepancies, a VBA script was developed in Microsoft Excel to compare column names and their order across workbooks, using the 2014 dataset as the reference.

# Data Loading
Data was imported into the database using LOAD DATA INFILE commands, ensuring proper formatting:

LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/oklahoma_cities.csv'
INTO TABLE cities
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES

# Remote Access
The database was connected to Google Colab using ngrok for remote access and analysis:

import pymysql

connection = pymysql.connect(
    host="4.tcp.ngrok.io",
    port=16944,
    user="proot",
    password="I*********5",
    database="oklahoma_crime_data"
)
print("Connection successful!")



# Data Imputation
## To address missing data, a new table, crimedata_imputed, was created by imputing values for cities with at least seven years of data.

### Methodology
Filtering: Identified cities with seven or more years of data.
Imputation Process:
Replaced zeros with NaN in crime-related columns (excluding population).
Applied linear interpolation across years for each numeric column.
Filled remaining gaps with the city-specific mean for each column, defaulting to 0 if the mean was unavailable.

# Data Analysis
Correlation Analysis
Correlation Analysis
Using crimedata_imputed joined with labor_statistics, correlations with total_offenses were:
â€¢	Strong Correlation: population (0.963651).
â€¢	Weak/Negligible Correlations: unemployment_rate (0.001092), unemployment (0.000746), labor_force (-0.002429), year (-0.002539), employment (-0.003691).

# Predictive Modeling
Models were trained to predict total_offenses using features: population, year, labor_force, employment, unemployment, and unemployment_rate.
